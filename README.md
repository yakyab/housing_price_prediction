# Housing Price Prediction - California Housing Data
This project aims to build a predictive model for housing prices based on the California Housing dataset. The dataset comprises various features such as median income, housing median age, average rooms per dwelling, average bedrooms per dwelling, population, average occupation, latitude, and longitude. The target variable is the median house value for California districts.

## Business Problem
The business problem this project tackles is the accurate prediction of house prices, which is a fundamental issue for various stakeholders such as homeowners, real estate agents, buyers, and sellers. Predicting housing prices can help in better understanding the real estate market, guide sellers in listing their properties, aid buyers in making purchasing decisions, and help real estate agents in estimating property value.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into multiple Jupyter notebooks each focusing on a different aspect of the data science workflow:

1. "Data Exploration and SQL Processing" - This notebook includes loading, exploring, and basic processing of the dataset using SQL.

2. "Big Data Processing with Apache Spark" - This notebook uses Spark for further data processing and preparation for modelling.

3. "Modelling and Deep Learning with TensorFlow" - In this notebook, we use TensorFlow to build and train predictive models, starting from a simple regression model and gradually increasing complexity with deep learning techniques.

4. "Model Evaluation and Optimization" - The last notebook is dedicated to evaluating the performance of the model(s) and optimizing them if necessary.

## Technological Stack
The project utilizes several technologies, frameworks, and libraries:

SQL - For data exploration and initial data processing.

Apache Spark - Used for big data processing and feature engineering.

TensorFlow - Used for building and training the predictive models, including deep learning models.

Python 3 - The main programming language used for the project. Python's extensive libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib are also used for data manipulation and visualization.

Jupyter Notebooks - Interactive computing environment that enables users to author notebook documents that include live code, markdown text, equations, and visualizations.
